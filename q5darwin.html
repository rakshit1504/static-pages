        <h2>On the Origin of The Origin</h2>
        <img class="darwin" src="darwin.jpg" alt="darwin">
        <p>Darwin's father was dead set on his son
            becoming a cleric but even though the young
            rapscallion began to study theology he found
            worms much more interesting.</p>
        <p>
            When a lonely man with a moustache asked
            Darwin to ride with him on his boat named after
            a dog, Darwin agreed and set off around the
            world fiddling with wildlife.</p>

        <p class="text">
            <br>
            Some say it was a load of birds from a bunch of
            islands hundreds of miles off the Ecuadorean
            coast that inspired his now widely accepted explanation of the
            mechanism of evolution. "Why does that bird on that island have a
            beak like that while that finch on that island has a beak like that?
            AHA! I've got it! Natural Selection!" he thought. It wasn't actually
            quite like that, but, y'know, it's a fine, popular romantic myth.

        <h2>The Origin</h2>
        <p>
            Upon return from his jaunt, Charles chronicled his escapades (as
            The Voyage of the Beagle) and got a bit carried away with
            barnacles, although his theory of evolution was always ticking away
            in the back of his mind.</p>
        <p>Some 20 or so year after he returned to England, a Welsh naturalist
            by the name of Wallace popped up with a similar idea to Darwin's
            grand theory. Darwin got a move on.</p>
